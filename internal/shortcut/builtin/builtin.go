// Package builtin aggregates all built-in shortcut service packages via blank
// imports so their init() registrations run, applies the reviewed semantic and
// public-catalog decorations in the core registry, then re-exports the compiled
// cobra commands. The host application depends only on this package, keeping
// the service packages free to import the core shortcut package without a cycle.
//
// Add a blank import here when a new service package is generated under
// internal/shortcut/<service>/.
